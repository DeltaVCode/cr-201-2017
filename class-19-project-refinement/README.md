# Today's Plan: Project Week, Day 4

## Announcements

- 1:1s this afternoon
- [IowaJS tonight @ 7:00 PM](https://www.meetup.com/iowajs/events/240907695/) featuring a Googler
  - Anyone want to carpool?
- Hard deadline for resubmission: **July 5th, 8:00 AM**
- Presentations tomorrow at **2:00 PM** in the café

## Presentation Prep

1. Test your presentation:
    - Take a few minutes at some point to take a look at your app on the projector/screen setup. You'll be glad you did. It's often a moment of, "THAT'S not what we want it to look like!"

2. Plan your presentation... have a script:
    - Who will give an intro, and tell us about the problem domain as well as your team's solution? In other words, a master of ceremonies, so to speak?
    - Who will talk about the functionality and walk us through the app?
    - Who will show us the code when you are showing off a technical challenge you overcame?
    - Individually, spend around 3 minutes speaking on the challenges that arose during project week, how your team overcame them, how you contributed to the solution, what you learned, and what you enjoyed working on, etc.

3. Rehearse your presentation:
    - Decide whose machine will present the app on the projector, test it, and then test a second computer… just in case.
    - Set a timer and take turns talking through your topics. Know how much time each segment will take.

4. Overall presentation timeline:
    - 5 minutes - Intro/demo
    - 3 minutes - Technical challenge in the codez
    - 3 minutes per person (9 minutes total, more or less)
    - 3 minutes - Q&A

## Project Status

- Start with meeting to assess Wednesday, then plan Thursday accordingly.
- Is GitHub up-to-date?
  - Are any open issues already done?
  - Are any active issues unassigned?
  - Are any issues missing?
  - Does `master` have **working** code?
  - Reminders:
    - Limit WIP (work in progress).
    - Put "Closes #1234" in Pull Request descriptions to auto-close an issue when
      the Pull Request is merged into `master`.
- Your goal today: polish & stretch goals.
  - No regressions (bugs in stuff that used to work)
  - Responsive design? **(consider how you will present this)**
  - Even if you don't complete a stretch goal, open a PR to communicate your progress
    and communicate what works and what doesn't

### Safety Tips

- **15 minutes**
- Be deliberate and careful with Git. Small branches and Pull Requests are best.
- Pair Programming is a great way to share knowledge and quickly work through
  items that may cause merge conflicts.
- Take breaks.
- Periodically (every few hours?) check in with the whole team, away from
  laptops, on progress.
  - What have you been working on?
  - What are you planning to work on next?
  - What's in your way?
- Don't let the tech distract you from what your users need.
- Focus. Focus. Focus. Core features first.

Your project should be **feature complete** at all times today.

**No new feature work tomorrow. Code cleanup and presentation prep only.**
