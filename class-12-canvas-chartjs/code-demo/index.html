      <p>Like many of its cephalopod cousins,
        the cuttlefish possesses one of the most potent intellects
        of all invertebrates. It possesses the ability to not
        only change its color, but also mold its shape and texture.
        It can fire protective jets of ink to confound its foes.
        The male cuttlefish displays its vigor by decorating and constructing
        tiny caves, or by imitating females in order to infiltrate the house-showings
        of the other male cuttlefish and dramatically revealing their true form.
