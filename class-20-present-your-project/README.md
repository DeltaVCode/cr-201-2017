# Today's Plan: Project Week, Day 5

## Announcements

- You made it! Congratulations!
- Half of you forgot journal/report. Reopened until noon.
- Presentations today at **2:00 PM** in the café
- Hard deadline for resubmission: **July 5th, 8:00 AM**

**No new feature work today. Code cleanup and presentation prep only.**

## Presentation Prep

1. Test your presentation:
    - Take a few minutes at some point to take a look at your app on the projector/screen setup. You'll be glad you did. It's often a moment of, "THAT'S not what we want it to look like!"

2. Plan your presentation... have a script:
    - Who will give an intro, and tell us about the problem domain as well as your team's solution? In other words, a master of ceremonies, so to speak?
    - Who will talk about the functionality and walk us through the app?
    - Who will show us the code when you are showing off a technical challenge you overcame?
    - Individually, spend around 3 minutes speaking on the challenges that arose during project week, how your team overcame them, how you contributed to the solution, what you learned, and what you enjoyed working on, etc.

3. Rehearse your presentation:
    - Decide whose machine will present the app on the projector, test it, and then test a second computer… just in case.
    - Set a timer and take turns talking through your topics. Know how much time each segment will take.

4. Overall presentation timeline:
    - 5 minutes - Intro/demo
    - 3 minutes - Technical challenge in the codez
    - 3 minutes per person (9 minutes total, more or less)
    - 3 minutes - Q&A
