# Today's Plan: Project Week, Day 3

## Announcements

- Hard deadline for resubmission: **July 5th, 8:00 AM**

## Aim for MVP

- Start with meeting to assess Tuesday, then plan Wednesday accordingly.
- Is GitHub up-to-date?
  - Are any open issues already done?
  - Are any active issues unassigned?
  - Are any issues missing?
  - Does `master` have **working** code?
  - Reminders:
    - Limit WIP (work in progress).
    - Put "Closes #1234" in Pull Request descriptions to auto-close an issue when
      the Pull Request is merged into `master`.
- Your goal today: MVP.
  - "Not pretty, but it works!"
  - Core features in place
  - Bugs worked out
  - Leave stretch goals, look & feel polish for tomorrow

Never too early to start thinking about presentations.

### Safety Tips

- **15 minutes**
- Be deliberate and careful with Git. Small branches and Pull Requests are best.
- Pair Programming is a great way to share knowledge and quickly work through
  items that may cause merge conflicts.
- Take breaks.
- Periodically (every few hours?) check in with the whole team, away from
  laptops, on progress.
  - What have you been working on?
  - What are you planning to work on next?
  - What's in your way?
- Don't let the tech distract you from what your users need.
- Focus. Focus. Focus. Core features first.

Your Minimum Viable Product should be **done** today.
