# Today's Plan: Project Week, Day 2

## Announcements

- Hard deadline for resubmission: **July 5th, 8:00 AM**

## Work Your Plan

- Make sure your project plan and user stories are in, or linked from, your
  project README.
- Use your GitHub plan to manage and divide up the work.
  - Aim for "issues" (stories/tasks) that will take between 30 minutes and 2 hours.
  - Limit WIP (work in progress).
  - Assign yourself to an issue when you begin work.
  - Put "Closes #1234" in Pull Request descriptions to auto-close an issue when
    the Pull Request is merged into `master`.
- Even if you talk through the code at the same computer (a good technique),
  use GitHub Pull Requests to communicate feedback, and address that feedback
  before merging Pull Requests.
  - **Everything in `master` should be *done* done.**
  - Don't forget to turn on GitHub Pages!

This should be a huge day of productivity, with tons of code written and
projects truly beginning to take shape.

### Safety Tips

- **15 minutes**
- Be deliberate and careful with Git. Small branches and Pull Requests are best.
- Pair Programming is a great way to share knowledge and quickly work through
  items that may cause merge conflicts.
- Take breaks.
- Periodically (every few hours?) check in with the whole team, away from
  laptops, on progress.
  - What have you been working on?
  - What are you planning to work on next?
  - What's in your way?
- Don't let the tech distract you from what your users need.
- Focus. Focus. Focus. Core features first.

You should be well on your way to having your Minimum Viable Product done tomorrow.
